# drafti-feature — Planning to Implementation Spec PRD

> Takes planning requirements and produces an implementation spec PRD focused on "how to build it."

## Bash Convention

Each Bash tool invocation is a fresh subshell. Every bash block re-declares `HARNISH_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"` inline; no persistent variables.

## Skill Chain

Can be invoked independently (planning doc required). Follow-up: "start implementation after review" → harnish, or "/ralphi to verify PRD consistency" → ralphi.

## Step 1: Requirement Parsing

Extract 4 items from the planning document:

| Item | Content |
|-----|------|
| Core Feature | User-visible changes (1~3 lines) |
| Success Metrics | KPI/goals (numeric or conditional) |
| User Flow | Happy path + branches |
| Non-Functional Requirements | Performance, security, accessibility |

**Gate**: all 4 items must be present before proceeding.
- 0 missing → proceed to Step 2.
- 1+ missing → ask the user for the missing items. Do not assume defaults. Re-evaluate after the user replies; if still missing → re-ask.

## Step 2: Existing Asset Query

Extract 3~5 core keywords, then:

```bash
HARNISH_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
if [[ -n "$HARNISH_ROOT" ]]; then
  bash "$HARNISH_ROOT/scripts/query-assets.sh" \
    --tags "{keywords}" --format inject \
    --base-dir "$(pwd)/.harnish"
fi
```

If assets found, use as reference; if none, proceed anyway.

## Step 3: Codebase Exploration

Detect the language from project config files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.), then explore affected files using core keywords.

1. **Keyword search**: Find related code files
2. **Filename patterns**: Find related components/modules
3. **Data models**: Find type definitions/interfaces/classes

Result: Affected file list + whether data model changes are needed → reflect in PRD §4.

## Step 4: Feature Flag Assessment (Optional)

**Not all features need a flag.** Design one only when the conditions below apply.

| Condition | Flag Needed | Not Needed |
|------|-----------|--------|
| User-facing service, gradual rollout needed | ✓ | |
| High-risk features such as payments/finance | ✓ | |
| Internal tools, CLI, libraries, infrastructure | | ✓ |
| Simple bug fixes, refactoring | | ✓ |

If flag needed → read `references/feature-flag-patterns.md` and:
- Flag key: `{feature_name}_enabled`
- Select rollout strategy (percentage/segment/manual)
- Kill switch conditions (error rate > 1%, p99 > 500ms, etc.)
- Rollback plan

If not needed → §2 (Flag design) is **omitted** from the output PRD. Section numbers `§1, §3, §4, ...` remain unchanged (do not renumber). Proceed to Step 5.

## Step 5: Implementation Spec Writing

**Foundation for task decomposition. Be specific about file paths, functions, and branch locations.**

§4.1 Affected files:
```
| File Path | Change Type | Description | Flag Branch |
```

§4.2 Functions/Components: Input → Behavior → Output

§4.3 Flag branch locations (only when flag exists): File | Function | Location | Condition

§4.4 Data model (only when DB changes exist): Added fields + migration + rollback safety

Read `references/prd-template.md` and write accordingly.

## Step 6: Edge Cases + Tests

**When flag exists**: Separate into ON/OFF/partial rollout cases
**When no flag**: Separate into normal/error/boundary value cases

§6 Test Criteria (Acceptance Criteria):
- Verify new feature behavior
- Verify existing feature regression
- (When flag exists) 100% restoration of existing behavior after rollback

## Step 7: Save + Asset Recording

**HITL** (before any file write):
> "PRD draft ready: §{sections present} ({with/without} flag). Save to `docs/prd-{slug}.md`? (y / n / edit-slug)"

- `n` → end. PRD not saved.
- `edit-slug` → ask for slug, then `y`.
- `y` → proceed with save below.

Save PRD (only after `y`):
```bash
mkdir -p docs/
# Write PRD content to docs/prd-{slug}.md
```

PRD section structure:
| Section | Content |
|------|------|
| §1 | Planning summary |
| §2 | Flag design ← **omitted when flag is not needed; numbering of §3+ unchanged** |
| §3 | Technical design (affected files) |
| §4 | Implementation spec |
| §5 | Edge cases |
| §6 | Test criteria |
| §7 | Guardrails |
| §8 | Asset references |

Asset recording:
```bash
HARNISH_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
if [[ -n "$HARNISH_ROOT" ]]; then
  bash "$HARNISH_ROOT/scripts/record-asset.sh" \
    --type pattern --tags "{keywords}" \
    --title "{feature name} implementation pattern" --content "{summary}" \
    --base-dir "$(pwd)/.harnish"
fi
```

## Step 8: Completion

```
✅ PRD generated: docs/prd-{slug}.md
Includes: §4 Implementation spec / §6 Test criteria / §7 Guardrails
Next: "start implementation" after review, or /ralphi for consistency check.
```

## Distinction from drafti-architect

| User Request | Judgment | Skill |
|-----------|------|------|
| "Create PRD based on this planning doc" | Planning document exists | → drafti-feature |
| "How should I design this problem" | No planning doc | → drafti-architect |

## Context Budget

| When | Reads |
|---|---|
| Step 1 (Parsing) | Planning document, project config files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) |
| Step 2 (Asset query) | `.harnish/assets/*.jsonl` filtered by tags. Skip if `.harnish/` absent. |
| Step 3 (Codebase) | Keyword-matched files only. No full project tree read. |
| Step 4 (Flag) | `references/feature-flag-patterns.md` (only if flag needed) |
| Step 5 (Spec) | `references/prd-template.md` |
| Step 6 (Tests) | None |
| Step 7 (Save + record) | None (writes only — `docs/prd-*.md` and `.harnish/assets/*.jsonl`) |

Load **at most 1** reference at a time; switch when moving phase.

## Prohibited

- Guessing requirements without a planning doc (use drafti-architect instead)
- Forcing unnecessary feature flags (follow the Step 4 assessment table)
- Saving PRD without explicit user confirmation in Step 7
- Proceeding past Step 1 with any of the 4 required items missing
- Loading 2 references simultaneously
